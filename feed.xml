TL; DR

I was asked to change my role to that of coach. I gave that decision to the team I would coach. It terrified me to do that, but it was worth it.

Approached For a Change of Role

Mid April 2020, I was hired as a senior full-stack engineer, with the understanding that the company does not have coaches, and I would probably never hold that title. Th...

TL;DR

Human systems are at best a complex system. When we try to change that system we need to respect that system and understand it. Making changes that focus on simple answers but ignoring the complex parts of the system is inviting failure.

Introduction

I have been through several failed agile transformations and one successful one. To say that a ...

TL;DR

Communicating is hard. It is harder when that communication is intended to have an impact on those who receive it. It is too easy to be too accommodating and lose the thread of intent. It is also too easy to forget about the context of the audience and make the message unaccessible to them. By using a simple quadrant graph, I will talk about how to examin...

TL; Dr

Booklisp is a tool that makes managing your readme file easier and more dynamic.

What is Booklisp?

There are 4 types of open source (OO) software. The first is where the creator(s) see a general need and then go about providing a solution for that need. The second type of OO software, is where someone has a, potentially novel, idea and they go...

TL; DR

I needed a tool to allow me to manage local Azure Git directories from the Terminal. So, I built it and am sharing it.

What is Project Sync

This is a tool born out of need. My team works in an extensive Azure DevOps Repository, and I have a need to keep my working repository list to a minimum. Which means, I find myself deleting repositories, and then looking for them again in a mo...
